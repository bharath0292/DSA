### 1. When to Use Stacks:

- Function call management (call stack)
- Expression evaluation
- Backtracking algorithms
- Undo/Redo operations
- Browser history

### 2. Performance Considerations:

- Push/Pop operations: O(1)
- Memory usage: O(n)
- Consider using a pre-allocated capacity when size is known

#### Best Practices:

- Always check for stack overflow/underflow
- Use generic implementations when possible
- Consider thread safety for concurrent applications
- Implement proper error handling
