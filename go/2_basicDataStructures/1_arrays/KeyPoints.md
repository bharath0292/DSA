### 1. Sliding Window:
  - Great for substring/subarray problems
  - Reduces time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n)
  - Useful for fixed-size and variable-size windows
### 2. Two Pointers:
  - Useful for sorted arrays
  - Can solve problems with O(n) time complexity
  - Common in array manipulation problems
### 3. Prefix Sum:
  - Excellent for range queries
  - Preprocessing step is O(n)
  - Subsequent queries are O(1)


## Pattern Selection Tips:
  - Use Sliding Window for consecutive elements
  - Use Two Pointers for sorted array problems
  - Use Prefix Sum for range queries
  - Use Kadane's for maximum subarray problems
