### Space Complexity Summary:

- Singly Linked List: O(n) for storing n elements
- Doubly Linked List: O(n) for storing n elements
- Additional space for operations is typically O(1)
- Some recursive implementations might use O(n) stack space

### Time Complexity Summary:

- Access: O(n)
- Search: O(n)
- Insertion at beginning: O(1)
- Insertion at end: O(1) with tail pointer, O(n) without
- Deletion: O(n) to find + O(1) to delete
- Traversal: O(n)
