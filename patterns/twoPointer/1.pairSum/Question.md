# Two Sum - Pair sum in sorted array

## Problem Description

Given a 1-based indexed integer array arr[] that is sorted in non-decreasing order, along with an integer target. find two elements in the array such that their sum is equal to target. If such a pair exists, return the indices of the two elements in increasing order. If no such pair exists, return [-1, -1].

## Examples:

Input:
arr[] = {2, 7, 11, 15}, target = 9

Output: 1 2

Explanation: Since the array is 1-indexed, arr[1] + arr[2] = 2 + 7 = 9

Input:
arr[] = [1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11] target = 10

Output: 3 4

Explanation: Since the array is 1-indexed, arr[3] + arr[5] = 4 + 6 = 10
